WIP toy-language to get re-familiarised with stuff other than JS.

It's important to stress that I in no way claim to have the faintest clue about
best practices in C++, or language development. Take from this what you will.

Requires C++11 or higher to compile.

See `./compiler` for compiler source code; `./docs` for descriptions of the
(WIP) syntax, and `./examples` for some code snippets.
