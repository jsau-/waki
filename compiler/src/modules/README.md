# Modules

Defintions of modules which form the standard library. These might be
pre-defined global functions, or variables. These definitions are used by
the type-checker to verify that things like global functions exist.

When we get towards implementing either the compiler phase (or build an
interpreter instead), we'll also be fleshing these things out with an actual
implementation that can be used!
